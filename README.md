# üìö Kaggle Notebook Archive

This repository is a collection of Jupyter notebooks originally published on Kaggle. It includes work on a variety of data science and machine learning tasks, ranging from exploratory data analysis and feature engineering to model development and evaluation.

The goal of this archive is to document personal progress, share useful approaches, and provide a reference for future projects. All notebooks were developed using real-world datasets available through Kaggle and reflect a hands-on, project-based approach to learning and experimentation.
